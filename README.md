# 4-Bit-Microcontroller
This is a basic 4-bit microcontroller built using Logisim software, designed for educational and learning purposes. It features a custom instruction set with 16 instructions, 16 bytes of program space, and 8 bytes of nibble-addressable RAM. The microcontroller doesn't have any input/output interface, protocol support, debugging support or even assembler or compiler.
This microcontroller is not suitable for any real-time applications, it is built for learning the basics of microcontroller architecture, assembly language programming and understanding how a microcontroller works. The repository includes the source files for the microcontroller, schematics, documentation, and example programs. The user is expected to have basic knowledge of assembly language programming to work with this microcontroller.
